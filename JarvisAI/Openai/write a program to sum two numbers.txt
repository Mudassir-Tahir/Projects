OpenAI response for Prompt: Jarvis using artificial intelligence write a program to sum two numbers 
 ***********************

Certainly! Here is an example program in Python to sum two numbers:

```python
# Function to sum two numbers
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# User input for numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum
sum_result = add_numbers(num1, num2)

# Output the result
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", sum_result)
```

To run this program, you can simply copy and paste it into a Python editor or use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to execute the code.
